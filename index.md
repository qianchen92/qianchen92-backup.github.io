# Chen Qian (钱宸)

I am currently a Post-Doc researcher at NTNU, Trondheim, Norway in the group of Jiaxin Pan and Kristian Gjøsteen.

In October 2019, I obtained my Ph.D. from Univ Rennes 1 (France) under the supervision of Benoît Libert, Pierre-Alain Fouque and Adeline Roux-Langlois. I am interested in theoretical and practical cryptography in general.
