# Chen Qian 钱宸
I am currently a researcher (tenure-track professor) at Shandong University, China.

From 2019 to 2022, I worked as a Post-Doc researcher at NTNU (Norway) in the group of Jiaxin Pan and Kristian Gjøsteen. In October 2019, I obtained my Ph.D. from Univ Rennes 1 (France) under the supervision of Benoît Libert, Pierre-Alain Fouque and Adeline Roux-Langlois. 

I am interested in all theoretical and practical cryptography in general.
